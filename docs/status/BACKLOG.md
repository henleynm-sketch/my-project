# Backlog

Living list of work across Henley Contracting's parallel Claude branches.
Edit freely — Claude reads this every morning via `/daily`.

Convention: `[ ]` = open, `[x]` = done (keep done items for ~1 week then prune).

---

## Henley Hub (platform) — `claude/henley-hub-platform-2wIAN`

### In flight
- [ ] Verify BT import works end-to-end in Codespace — first login, click around, paste any errors
- [ ] Confirm all 7 import files load (contacts, leads, subs, jobsites, milestones, profitability, hubspot)

### Next up
- [ ] Subs directory page (list + detail) using BT subs import
- [ ] Build out **Contracts** stub: Estimate → Contract conversion + PDF + e-sign + deposit
- [ ] **Files** module: per-project library with role visibility (R2/S3)
- [ ] **Selections** module: client-facing approval flow with deadlines
- [ ] **QuickBooks Online** OAuth + customer/invoice/payment sync (schema already has `qbCustomerId`)
- [ ] **Field time clock** tied to daily log hours
- [ ] **Email/SMS gateway**: outbound delivery + inbound parsing (UI is real, transport is not)

### Decisions deferred (Nick to decide)
- [ ] **Henley Hub vs JobTread** — evaluate JT seriously (build read-only JT MCP server?)
- [ ] **Deploy to Vercel + Neon Postgres** for a shareable preview URL — yes/no/when?
- [ ] **SQLite → Postgres** migration — before or after first deploy?

---

## Marketing Hub — `claude/marketing-hub-setup-zE3Tu`

### Last known state
- Worklist UI with draft/approve/skip flow shipped
- HubSpot priority scoring from engagement signals shipped
- Multi-source ingest with cross-source dedup shipped
- Send button → connector dispatcher (dry-run) shipped

### Next up
- [ ] (Nick: fill in — I haven't deep-reviewed this branch yet. Want me to do a walkthrough?)
